        "Summary and findings: In summary, the choice of gae_lambda in GAE allows us to adjust the balance between using short-term and long-term information when estimating advantages. A value of 0, which is vanilla advantage, emphasizes short-term advantages(more weights on current reward) and a value of 1, which is n-step advantage, uses full n-step returns(more weights on future reward), and values between 0 and 1 is GAE advantage that provides a flexible way to control the trade-off between bias and variance in advantage estimation during training. The MC advantages uses full returns/awards from obtained from the sample trajectories.(can not be implemented easily)\n",
        "\n",
        "From the result, we see that vanilla advantage did the worst followed by GAE and n-step advantage did the best. However, GAE advantage should be considered as it has a balance between variance and bias."
